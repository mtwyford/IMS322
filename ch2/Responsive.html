        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>This page is in update status - several of the links were within MiamiOH's Canvas pages, and aaccess is no longer available - migrating to open source resources.</p>
      <p>In this module, we will explore how responsive web design (RWD) works. RWD is an approach to web design aimed at allowing desktop webpages to be viewed in response to the size of the screen or web browser one is viewing with. A site designed with RWD adapts the layout to the viewing environment by using fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries.</p>

        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The fluid grid concept calls for page element sizing to be in relative units like percentages, rather than absolute units like pixels or points.</li>
            <li>Flexible images are also sized in relative units, so as to prevent them from displaying outside their containing element.</li>
            <li>Media queries allow the page to use different CSS style rules based on characteristics of the device the site is being displayed on, most commonly the width of the browser.</li>
        </ul>

<p>JavaScript is a <strong>scripted or interpreted language</strong> that runs as-is in the browser.&nbsp; Unlike some typical programming languages that are written in syntax close to English, then compiled to assembly or even machine code, JavaScript is saved to a web server as-is and called or run by the page when the html page loads.</p>
<p><strong>How is it used</strong>?&nbsp; Javascript works in collaboration with other web technologies, like html and css.&nbsp; Think of the latest version of html5 like a <strong>three-legged stool</strong>.&nbsp; Working together, they make rich, interactive pages and web sites, that entertain and inform users with content that changes as the needs of the user changes.&nbsp; Think about how you might customize a web site or page.&nbsp; Put in name, login, location, or other preferences, or search for elements within a shopping site to display custom results on a page based on what you asked.&nbsp; This is the magic of dynamic, flexible web pages that can appear different to different users.</p>
<p>Java? No - Java is an object oriented program developed by James Gosling and team&nbsp; starting in 1991 and released by Sun Microsystems in 1996.&nbsp; Java is currently managed by Oracle.&nbsp; Java needs to be compiled and does not need to be run through a browser.&nbsp; so in short, JavaScript and Java are not the same.</p>
<p>What can I do with JavaScript? - Create user interactions, play games, draw animations and graphs, run calculations and simulations, and more.&nbsp; 3d? Yep.&nbsp; CAD? Yep.&nbsp; &nbsp;You name it.&nbsp; If you saw it on the web, javascript probably played a part.</p>
